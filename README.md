Travel API
Build an API that allows users to GET and POST reviews about various travel destinations around the world. Here are some user stories to get started. Note that you will have to create custom endpoints for some of these user stories.

User Should:

- GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
- GET reviews by country or city.
- see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
- PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if USER wrote them.
  (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
- look up random destinations just for fun.
